## DeBaun PAC Student Staff

You should always be able to find the most resent version of this page at <https://debaun-pac.github.io/debaunstaff/>. Eventually, IT may be able to give us a friendlier URL pointer.

Normally Shawna wrangles the student staff, but for now, email Carl <crussell@stevens.edu> to sign up for any of the events below that match your interests and availability, and I’ll add you to the roster. Once confirmed, just show up at the listed call time, and we’ll get started.

If you have any questions or concerns about the gig or about what the roles will entail, please ask. The jobs can vary quite a bit depending on the particular gig. The listed roles are the ideal crew for the events. If we’re short a person or two, we may need to juggle staff around to compensate.

If you’re new to the DeBaun PAC crew, feel free to sign up for events even if the roles are filled, as we’ll have you shadow someone who has performed the role before, so you can see how we operate. You’ll catch on quickly.


## Events
*(at DeBaun Auditorium unless otherwise noted)*

### recurring weekly classes in the theater

These classes require light A/V support. We're looking for consistent weekly staff that can sign up for a block of at least a few hours, to keep the scheduling from becoming too terribly complicated.

*Mondays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 3pm classes*

- staff: ?

*Wednesdays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 2pm classes*

- staff: ?





### loft exit and backstage reorganization crew calls
*Thu & Fri, 14/15 Oct 1-6pm*

Stop by when you are able, to help with the final days of the loft exit and the subsequent backstage reorganizaiton. Wear sensible shoes and clothing and bring your caffineated selves backstage, as there is plenty to do.
