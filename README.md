## DeBaun PAC Student Staff

You should always be able to find the most resent version of this page at <https://debaun-pac.github.io/debaunstaff/>. Eventually, IT may be able to give us a friendlier URL pointer.

Normally Shawna wrangles the student staff, but for now, email Carl <crussell@stevens.edu> to sign up for any of the events below that match your interests and availability, and I’ll add you to the roster. Once confirmed, just show up at the listed call time, and we’ll get started.

If you have any questions or concerns about the gig or about what the roles will entail, please ask. The jobs can vary quite a bit depending on the particular gig. The listed roles are the ideal crew for the events. If we’re short a person or two, we may need to juggle staff around to compensate.

If you’re new to the DeBaun PAC crew, feel free to sign up for events even if the roles are filled, as we’ll have you shadow someone who has performed the role before, so you can see how we operate. You’ll catch on quickly.

### Jazz Band performance (recording sessions)

*Wed 8 Dec ~ 6pm setup / 7pm recording start*

*Fri 10 Dec ~ 6pm setup / 7pm recording start*

The Stevens Bands will be performing without a live audience this fall, to be able to spread out further into the theater, keeping a safe distance between performers. Both evenings will be recorded and mixed together in post.

### Choir performance (live audience)

*Mon 6 Dec ~ 6:30pm dress rehearsal*

*Thu 9 Dec ~ 6:30pm dress rehearsal*

*Sat 11 Dec ~ 6:30pm call / 8pm performance*

The Stevens Choir has been deconstructed into smaller units, for safe rehearsal and performance, and will perform sequestially, to a live audience. The sound and video recording ops would ideally also be availble for the Mon/Thu dress rehearsals to set recording levels and adjust mics as needed. Stage Manager and House Manager are only needed for the Saturday performance.
