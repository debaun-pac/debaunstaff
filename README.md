## DeBaun PAC Student Staff

You should always be able to find the most resent version of this page at <https://debaun-pac.github.io/debaunstaff/>. Eventually, IT may be able to give us a friendlier URL pointer.

Normally Shawna wrangles the student staff, but for now, email Carl <crussell@stevens.edu> to sign up for any of the events below that match your interests and availability, and I’ll add you to the roster. Once confirmed, just show up at the listed call time, and we’ll get started.

If you have any questions or concerns about the gig or about what the roles will entail, please ask. The jobs can vary quite a bit depending on the particular gig. The listed roles are the ideal crew for the events. If we’re short a person or two, we may need to juggle staff around to compensate.

If you’re new to the DeBaun PAC crew, feel free to sign up for events even if the roles are filled, as we’ll have you shadow someone who has performed the role before, so you can see how we operate. You’ll catch on quickly.


## Events
*(at DeBaun Auditorium unless otherwise noted)*

### recurring weekly classes in the theater

These classes require light A/V support. We're looking for consistent weekly staff that can sign up for a block of at least a few hours, to keep the scheduling from becoming too terribly complicated.

*Mondays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 3pm classes*

*Wednesdays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 2pm classes*

- staff: ?


### Stevens Dramatic Society Performances

*11/12/13 Nov*

DeBaun PAC staff is not typically required for these performances. If you are inclined to get involved with SDS (which I can certainly recommend), do contact them directly.


### Instrument Shift Across Campus

*Thu 18 Nov ~ afternoon crew call*

This is the day we will be shifting the departmental instruments from the Music Room to DeBaun Auditorium, for the Orchestra, Concert Band, and Jazz Band. It's a fair bit of gear, so all available hands are requested.
