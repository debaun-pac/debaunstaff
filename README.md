## DeBaun PAC Student Staff

You should always be able to find the most resent version of this page at <https://debaun-pac.github.io/debaunstaff/>. Eventually, IT may be able to give us a friendlier URL pointer.

Normally Shawna wrangles the student staff, but for now, email Carl <crussell@stevens.edu> to sign up for any of the events below that match your interests and availability, and I’ll add you to the roster. Once confirmed, just show up at the listed call time, and we’ll get started.

If you have any questions or concerns about the gig or about what the roles will entail, please ask. The jobs can vary quite a bit depending on the particular gig. The listed roles are the ideal crew for the events. If we’re short a person or two, we may need to juggle staff around to compensate.

If you’re new to the DeBaun PAC crew, feel free to sign up for events even if the roles are filled, as we’ll have you shadow someone who has performed the role before, so you can see how we operate. You’ll catch on quickly.


## Events
*(at DeBaun Auditorium unless otherwise noted)*

### recurring weekly classes in the theater

These classes require light A/V support. We're looking for consistent weekly staff that can sign up for a block of at least a few hours, to keep the scheduling from becoming too terribly complicated.

*Mondays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 3pm classes*

- staff: ?

*Wednesdays ~ 8:30am setup / 9am - 2pm classes*

### instrument shift across campus

*Thu 18 Nov ~ noon crew call*

This is the day we will be shifting the departmental instruments from the Music Room to DeBaun Auditorium, for the Orchestra, Concert Band, and Jazz Band. It's a fair bit of gear, so all available hands are requested. Best to gather at the Music Room, to grab our department's percussion, amps and music folders, to roll them (gently) across campus to the theater. Gear can be put directly on stage. We'll repeat this cycle as necessary.

### Voice Studio recital (live invited audience)

*Fri 19 Nov ~ 6pm set up / 7pm recital*

Students in the DeBaun PAC Voice Studio, under Bethany Reeves' direction, present their work each semester. This event is held in the Ondrick Music Room, which we spiff up a bit for the night. Ushers are needed from about 6-8pm, but we'll set up the video recording mid-afternoon, for anyone interested in keeping an eye on the camera for the performance.

### Orchestra performance (recording session)

*Fri 19 Nov ~ afternoon set up / 6pm-ish recording*

In a last-minute adjustment, the Stevens Orchestra has asked to perform at the theater, without a live audience, in order to spread out further into the space, which will allow the entire gang to safely perform together. We'll make both audio and video recordings of the gig. Based on the musician's availability, their usual Friday evening dress rehearsal slot is a better recording date.

### Phi Sig Lip Sync

*Mon, 22 Nov ~ 3:30pm load-in / evening event*

As titled, this is a Lip Sync contest that Phi Sig hosts annually. We'll do our best to gather technical details in advance and provide lighting, sound, and organizational support. Further details will be shared as they materialize.

### crew call ~ set up for Concert Band rehearsal

*Tue 23 Nov ~ afternoon crew call*

### Tree Lighting

*Tue 30 Nov ~ afternoon setup / evening event*

We will handle some of the sound and lighting support for the annual tree lighting event, at Babbio and perhaps Walker porch as well. We'll have more information shortly.


### Conversation with the President

*Wed 1 Dec ~ 2pm setup / 3pm event / 4:30pm breakdown*

Nariman will be presenting to the Stevens community at the theater. The event is technically straightforward, but the audience tends to be sizable for these events, so we'll need a few folks to support this.

### crew call ~ quick stage changeover

*Wed 1 Dec ~ 4:30pm crew call*

Immediately after Nariman's presentation, we'll need to quickly set up for this evening's Jazz Band rehearsal.

### Concert Band performance (recording sessions)

*Fri 3 Dec ~ evening recording*
*Sat 4 Dec ~ evening recording*

The Stevens Bands will be performing without a live audience this fall, to be able to spread out further into the theater, keeping a safe distance between performers. Both evenings will be recorded and mixed together in post.

### Shakespeare (A Midsummer Night's Dream) auditions

*Tue 7 Dec ~ 6:30pm start / 9:45pm end*

We'll need someone to staff the audition table, taking information from auditionees and distributing sides to those wishing to audition. We can probably make this work, even if you intend to audition yourself.

### Jazz Band performance (recording sessions)

*Wed 8 Dec ~ evening recording*
*Fri 10 Dec ~ evening recording*

The Stevens Bands will be performing without a live audience this fall, to be able to spread out further into the theater, keeping a safe distance between performers. Both evenings will be recorded and mixed together in post.

### Choir performance (live audience)

*Mon 6 Dec ~ evening dress rehearsal*
*Thu 9 Dec ~ evening dress rehearsal*
*Sat 11 Dec ~ evening performance*

The Stevens Choir has been deconstructed into smaller units, for safe rehearsal and performance, and will perform sequestially, to a live audience. The sound and video recording ops would ideally also be availble for the Mon/Thu dress rehearsals to set recording levels and adjust mics as needed. Stage Manager and House Manager are only needed for the Saturday performance.
